## 🎯  Why This Repo Exists  

This public repository captures **LaLa’s first end-to-end web project** *and* the core concepts she explored while building it:

- Getting comfortable in **Visual Studio Code** (extensions, source control, Live Server)  
- Understanding what **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** each contribute to a page  
- Seeing where **compilers, interpreters, and the browser rendering pipeline** fit together  
- Rapid-prototyping with a starter from **DeepSite** and customizing it line-by-line  
- Version-controlling with **Git** and free hosting via **GitHub Pages**

Everything is intentionally lightweight—no frameworks—so the fundamentals stay visible.

## 🛠️  Run Locally

```

Open **http://localhost:5500** (or whatever port the terminal shows).

## 🧠  Key Concepts Logged

| Concept | TL;DR |
|---------|-------|
| **“What *is* code?”** | Human-readable instructions → parsed → machine code → rendered/executed |
| **Compilers vs. Interpreters** | Compilers translate a whole program before run-time (e.g., C); browsers interpret JS on the fly; modern bundlers blur that line |
| **Git workflow** | `git add → commit → push` snapshots progress; GitHub Pages auto-builds from `main` |
| **Rapid prototyping** | Starting with a DeepSite boilerplate kept momentum high while each section was rewritten from scratch |
